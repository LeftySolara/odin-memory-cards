# Memory Cards

A simple memory game. You are presented with multiple images of food that are shuffled around every time one is clicked. If you click an image more than once, the game ends and your score is reset.

This is my solution to the [Memory Card assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card) from the Odin Project's [Full Stack JaveScript Track](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript).
